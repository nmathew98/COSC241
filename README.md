# Coursework for COSC241 Programming and Problem Solving

COSC241 builds upon and extends on COMP160, more advanced programming ideas such as recursion and abstract data type design are introduced as well as their implementations in Java. A variety of different data structures are discussed together with the algorithms to query and modify them. Theoretical and practical analyses of efficiency are also used throughout the course. I have uploaded all the coursework I could find though there are a few that are missing.
